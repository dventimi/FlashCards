* Mergesort

  - What is the basic plan for Mergesort?  ::

    - Divide the array into two halves.

    - Recursively sort each half.

    - Merge the two halves.

  - What is the worst-case number of compare operations $C_N$ for Mergesort?  ::

       \[ C_N \le N \lg N \]

  - What is the worst-case number of array accesses $A_N$ for Mergesort?  ::

       \[ A_N \le 6N \lg N \]

  - How much extra space does Mergesort of an array of size $N$ use?  ::

       \[ \propto N \]

  - What is the definition of /in-place/ for a sorting algorithm? :: 

       A sorting algorithm is /in-place/ if it uses $\le c \log N$
       extra memory.

  - What are some practical improvements for Mergesort? :: 

    - Use insertion sort for small sub-arrays.

    - Stop if the array already is sorted.

    - Switch the roles of the input and auxiliary array in each
      recursive step.

  - What is the basic plan of the bottom-up Mergesort?  ::

    - Pass through the array, merging sub-arrays of size 1.

    - Repeat for sub-arrays of $2^N$.

  - What are some trade-offs of the bottom-up Mergesort?  ::

    - It is simpler.

    - It is about 10% slower.

  - What is a definition of /Computational complexity/?  ::

       /Computational complexity/ is a framework to study the
       efficiency of algorithms for solving a particular problem $X$.

  - What is a definition of /Model of computation/?  :: 

       /Model of computation/ comprises the allowable operations.

  - What is a definition of /Cost model/?  :: 

       /Cost model/ is an enumeration of an algorithm's operation
       counts.

  - What is a definition of /Upper bound/?  :: 

       /Upper bound/ is the cost guarantee provided by *some*
       algorithm for $X$.

  - What is a definition of /Lower bound/?  :: 

       /Lower bound/ is the proven limit on the cost guarantee of
       *all* algorithms for $X$.

  - What is a definition of /Optimal algorithm/?  :: 

       An /Optimal algorithm/ is one with the best possible cost
       guarantee for $X$.

       \[ \text{lower bound} \sim \text{upper bound} \]

  - What is the model of computation for sorting?  :: 

       decision tree

  - What is the cost model for sorting?  :: 

       the number of compare operations

  - What sorting algorithm is optimal with respect to $C_N$? ::

       Mergesort

  - What are the relationships between *upper bound*, *lower bound*, *best case*, and *worst case*? :: 

    - *upper bound* = *worst case*

    - *lower bound* = *best case*

  - What is the worst-case performance of any compare-based sorting algorithm?  ::

       \[ C_N \ge \lg (N!) \sim N \lg N \]

  - When might the lower-bound fail?  :: 

    - partially-ordered arrays

    - duplicate keys

    - digital properties of keys

  - What is the definition of a /stable sorting algorithm/?  ::

       A /stable sorting algorithm/ is one that preserves the relative
       order of items that have equal keys.

  - Which sorts are stable? :: 

    - Insertion sort

    - Mergesort

  - What criteria applies to stable sorting algorithms?  ::

       Stable sorting algorithms do not perform long-distance
       exchanges that might move equal items past each other.

  - Where is Mergesort used in Java?  ::

       Mergesort is the standard system sort for Java objects.

* Quicksort

  - Were is Quicksort used in Java?  ::

       Quicksort is the standard system sort for Java primitive types.

  - What is the basic plan for Quicksort?  :: 

    - Shuffle the array.

    - Partition the array on $j$ into two cells:

      - $a_i < a_j \text{for} i < j$

      - $a_i > a_j \text{for} i > j$

    - Sort each cell recursively.

  - What is the basic plan for Quicksort partitioning?  ::

       Repeat until $i$ and $j$ pointers cross:

    - Scan $i$ from left to right so long as $a_i < a_{lo}$.

    - Scan $j$ from right to left so long as $a_j > a_{lo}$.

    - When /both/ of the above conditions are met, exchange $a_i$ with
      $a_j$.

  - Should a Quicksort implementation us an extra array?  ::

       Though it makes partitioning easier and stable, it incurs the
       extra space penalty that Mergesort does.  In that case, one
       might as well just use Mergesort.

  - Why is it necessary to shuffle the array first in Quicksort?  :: 

       Shuffling is necessary to provided the performance guarantee.

  - What is the best-case performance for Quicksort?  :: 

       \[ \sim N \lg N \]

  - What is the worst-case performance for Quicksort?  :: 

       \[ \sim \frac{1}{2} N^2 \]

  - What is the average number of compare operations $C_N$ for $N$ distinct keys in Quicksort? :: 

       \[ \sim 2 N \ln N \]

  - If Mergesort uses slightly fewer compare operations than Quicksort does then why is Quicksort typically faster? :: 

       Quicksort typically is faster than Mergesort because in
       practice it performs fewer data movement operations.

  - Is Quicksort in-place?  :: 

       yes

  - Is Quicksort stable?  :: 

       no

  - What are some practical improvements for Quicksort?  :: 

    - Revert to insertion sort for 10 or so items.

    - Take median as pivot item.

    - Estimate median by taking the median of a sample.

    - Or take median-of-3

  - What are some applications for Quickselect?  ::

    - order statistics

    - find the "top $k$."

  - What is the basic plan for Quickselect?  ::

    - Partition the array as in Quicksort.

    - Repeat only in /one/ cell, either the left or the right, as $k >
      j$ or $k < j$.

  - What is the average performance of Quickselect?  ::

       Quickselect on average is linear.

  - What is the worst-case performance of Quickselect?  :: 

       The worst-case performance of Quickselect is quadratic, just as
       it is with Quicksort.

  - What is 3-way partitioning?  :: 

       3-way partitioning is a Quicksort scheme that partitions the
       array into 3 cells instead of 2, which copes well with
       duplicate keys.

  - In practice what is the average performance of 3-way partitioning randomized Quicksort? :: 

       linear

  - What is "Tukey's ninther?"  :: 

       "Tukey's ninther" is a median estimator, taken from the median
       of the median of 3 samples, each sample of 3 entries.
